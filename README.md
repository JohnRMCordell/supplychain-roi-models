#  Supply Chain ROI & COI Models

This repository contains example frameworks and methodologies I’ve developed for modeling **Return on Investment (ROI)** and **Cost of Inactivity (COI)** in enterprise SaaS, logistics, and manufacturing environments.

These models are designed to help organizations build defensible business cases for technology adoption, supply chain transformation, and automation initiatives.

---

###  Key Focus Areas
- **Cost of Inactivity (COI):** Quantifying opportunity cost and financial risk of inaction.  
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Scenario modeling for SaaS and process automation investments.  
- **Intangible Benefit Conversion:** Translating qualitative value (risk reduction, time savings, decision velocity) into measurable financial metrics.  
- **Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis:** Monte Carlo simulation and risk-adjusted ROI frameworks.

###  Example Model Types
| Model | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Logistics Optimization ROI** | Measures savings from TMS/route automation and carrier consolidation. |
| **Procurement Automation COI** | Quantifies manual processing costs and opportunity loss from delayed decisions. |
| **SaaS Platform ROI** | Calculates payback period, NPV, and internal rate of return for subscription investments. |
| **Operational Efficiency Gains** | Converts time or FTE reallocation into monetary impact for financial justification. |
